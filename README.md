# RecNet Photos Bot
I got tired of having to download the photos from RecNet and reuploading them on discord to show my friends, so instead of doing a task that would take a few minutes, i made the sane decision to take a few days to do that task automatically for me.


RecNet Photos Bot is a discord bot that utilizes the RecNet API to periodically send new photos taken by users into a discord channel.

## üåÖ Features
You can subscribe to a user using `rr!subscribe <username>`, and when a subscribed user uploads new photo(s) to RecNet, the bot will send them to a designated channel that can be set with `rr!channel <#channel>`.

When a new photo is taken, the bot will send a photo into the channel with a thread for people to discuss the image.

Unrelated to photos, but the bot can also show information of a users profile.

## üõ† Requirements
1. Node.js 16.15+
2. Discord Bot Token

## üîå Installation
Add your bot token to `src/config.json`, you can also change the prefix if you like (Bot icon provided in media as `icon.png`). Then, use either NPM or Yarn to install all dependencies in the project and build the project. For this example I will be using Yarn.
```bash
# Install all dependancies
yarn install

# Build the project using typescript (Do this after adding the token)
yarn build

# Run the project
yarn start
```
